- **Real-Time Map**: Utilizes the Leaflet library to display a dynamic map that updates as you add workout entries.
- **Workout Markers**: Custom markers for running and cycling that display key information when clicked.
- **Local Storage**: Your workout data is saved in your browser, so you can continue where you left off.
- **Interactive UI**: A clean and responsive interface with form inputs dynamically changing based on activity type.
